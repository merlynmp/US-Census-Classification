# ## Part 1: Load the Data Set
# 
# 
# You have chosen to work with one of four data sets. The data sets are located in a folder named "data." The file names of the three data sets are as follows:
# 
# * The "adult" data set that contains Census information from 1994 is located in file `adultData.csv`
# * The airbnb NYC "listings" data set is located in file  `airbnbListingsData.csv`
# * The World Happiness Report (WHR) data set is located in file `WHR2018Chapter2OnlineData.csv`
# * The book review data set is located in file `bookReviewsData.csv`
# 
# 
# 
# <b>Task:</b> In the code cell below, use the same method you have been using to load your data using `pd.read_csv()` and save it to DataFrame `df`.

# ## Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
# 
# The next step is to inspect and analyze your data set with your machine learning problem and project plan in mind. 
# 
# This step will help you determine data preparation and feature engineering techniques you will need to apply to your data to build a balanced modeling data set for your problem and model. These data preparation techniques may include:
# * addressing missingness, such as replacing missing values with means
# * renaming features and labels
# * finding and replacing outliers
# * performing winsorization if needed
# * performing one-hot encoding on categorical features
# * performing vectorization for an NLP problem
# * addressing class imbalance in your data sample to promote fair AI
# 
# 
# Think of the different techniques you have used to inspect and analyze your data in this course. These include using Pandas to apply data filters, using the Pandas `describe()` method to get insight into key statistics for each column, using the Pandas `dtypes` property to inspect the data type of each column, and using Matplotlib and Seaborn to detect outliers and visualize relationships between features and labels. If you are working on a classification problem, use techniques you have learned to determine if there is class imbalance.
# 
# 
# <b>Task</b>: Use the techniques you have learned in this course to inspect and analyze your data. 
# 
# <b>Note</b>: You can add code cells if needed by going to the <b>Insert</b> menu and clicking on <b>Insert Cell Below</b> in the drop-drown menu.

# Every other bar seems to be equally divided.

# Majority of values comes from Bachelors, HS-grad, and some-college. There is a huge difference between the amount of non-females that graduated compared to the females. Some-college seems to be better, with an close equal divide. However, there are many non-females who receive bachelors than females

# Below, there is an equal divide between the non-females and females in the not-married category. However, there is a large difference in the married category, where non-female takes up a large amount of the data. To me, this is suprising because I would think it would be the other around with Females taking up most of the married.

# When addressing the imbalance by increasing Married and low-income females, it did not do much with increasing the accuracy of the models. Hence, I decided to keep the class imbalance so there would be less cost computation since there would not be a difference in the results.

# I chose to use accuracy_score and confusion matrix for evaluation because I thought it would be the easiest for someone who has no knowledge in machine learning to understand what the results are. 
# 
# Overall, with the accuracy score, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Random Forest, and Decision Trees performs the best with the score to stay around 80%. Logistic Regression and KNN both stayed in the 60s. This isnt bad, but 80s is the most preferable in this situation.
# 
# When looking at the confusion matrix, LR and KNN did not predict the Females well, overall both having 52 predictions for them. The non-females had more predictions. DT, RF, and GBC predicted both the Females and Non-females in a good amount. Predictions for females were in the 1000s, compared to LR and KNN. This is a big improvement.
